# SQL-complex-Running-my-own-music-store

### A project in a question-answer format which explores how we can answer key business questions for an online music store.

**Music store**

The database titled "chinook.db" is a subset of the Chinook sample data available at: https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database
It has been created using real data from iTunes. I used an SQlite server since the database is light-weight. 

It contains 11 tables that I worked with. You can refer to the schema below:-

You will find concepts such as Views, Joins across multiple tables, With clauses, and a generally higher grade of questions as compared to my SQL basics project. You can expect vizualtizations and inferences(as markup) to be added in the future.
